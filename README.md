# 200 GitHub Followers

On the afternoon of Tuesday 2nd May 2023, we hit 200 followers on Github! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

I would like to say another huge thank you to all of the GitHub community. I could have not gone this far without all your support! It has been only 7 months since I hit 100 GitHub followers. The follower count is always increasing faster and faster! Because of your help, I have also been able to make more programs and with that, I became 1st in the UK for pygame development (Data by CodersRank)!
